#14 What are negative indexes and why are they used

"""Negative indices in Python are used to access elements from the end of a sequence, 
such as a string or a list starts from -1 to n.
Negative indices are useful because they provide a convenient way to access elements 
from the end of a sequence without needing to know the length of the sequence beforehand.

negative indices provide a convenient and intuitive way to access elements from the end of a sequence in Python. 
They help simplify code and make it more readable, especially when dealing with sequences of varying lengths."""
